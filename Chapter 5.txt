Chapter 5
Python’s if statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state. At the heart of every if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as True or False and is called a conditional test. Python uses the values True and False to decide whether the code in an if statement should be executed. If a conditional test evaluates to True, Python executes the code following the if statement. If the test evaluates to False, Python ignores the code following the if statement.
Using a double equal sign (==). This equality operator returns True if the values on the left and right side of the operator match, and False if they don’t match. The inequality operator (!=)

cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']

for car in cars:
❶     if car == 'bmw':
        print(car.upper())
    else:
        print(car.title())

if-elif-else chain.
usernames = []
if usernames: (# the conditional boolean test is asking if this is a variable with a value. Is the value  present in memory T or F)
